# Final
UPDATED 4/26

So, this is what I've done so far.

You can look at the code if you click on the "Final" folder above and click Source.cpp.

Saving and loading removed. Maybe completely.


The controls are there and are a guideline of what you can do in game


The abandonedRoom is essentially what all the rooms would be like with directions, look around with the L, and Q and M.
Add your own touches to the room. Don't just leave them empty.


The Crowbar is an example of how to add stuff to the inventory, like the keycards or if you want to add another item.
Just set a global variable for it at the top and then look at the abandonedRoom function to see how it works.
I'll be adding more later today but I can't right now.

Fixed the looping errors from the other day

If you come up with any story ideas or anything, let me know or just add it to your room.
